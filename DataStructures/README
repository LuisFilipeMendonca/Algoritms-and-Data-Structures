SINGLY LINKED LISTS

    A data structure that contains a head, tail and length property.
    Linked Lists consit of nodes, and each node has a value and a pointer to another node or null.
    Are an excellent alternative to arrays when insertion and deletion at the beginning are frequently required.

   Head Length=4 Tail
    4 -> 6 -> 8 -> 2 ->
     next next next null

Comparisons with Arrays:

    Lists:
        - do not have indexes.
        - connected via nodes with a next pointer.
        - random access is not allowed.

    Arrays:
        - Indexed in order.
        - Insertion and deletion can be expensive.
        - Can quickly be accessed at a specific index.
